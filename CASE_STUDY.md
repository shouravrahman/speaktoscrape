# Case Study: How a Marketing Agency Accelerated Their Lead Generation with SpeakToScrape

**Company:** MarketLeap, a boutique marketing agency.

**The Challenge:** MarketLeap's primary lead generation strategy was to identify fast-growing e-commerce companies and offer them a free marketing audit. However, their process was slow and manual. A team of two junior analysts spent their days manually searching for companies, checking their social media presence, and looking for contact information. This resulted in a slow pipeline and high costs.

**The Goal:** MarketLeap wanted to automate their lead generation process to identify more qualified leads without increasing their headcount.

**The Solution:** MarketLeap's founder, a non-technical user, signed up for SpeakToScrape's Pro plan. In a single afternoon, she was able to create a series of scraping jobs to:

1.  Scrape a popular e-commerce platform for new stores with high ratings.
2.  For each store, find their official website.
3.  From the store's website, extract contact information.

**The Process:**

*   **Day 1:** The founder used SpeakToScrape's chat interface to create the scraping jobs. She started with a simple prompt: `"Scrape the top 100 new stores from the Shopify App Store."` She then created a second job: `"For each store in my previous scrape, find their official website."` Finally, she created a third job: `"For each website, find the email address on their contact page."`
*   **Day 2:** The founder had a clean, structured list of over 100 potential leads, complete with contact information. She was able to hand this list directly to her sales team.
*   **Ongoing:** The scraping jobs were set to run weekly, providing a continuous flow of new leads.

**The Results:**

*   **Increased Lead Velocity:** MarketLeap was able to generate a month's worth of leads in a single day.
*   **Reduced Manual Work:** The two junior analysts were freed up to work on higher-value tasks, such as personalizing outreach to the new leads.
*   **Positive ROI:** The cost of the SpeakToScrape Pro plan was significantly less than the cost of hiring another analyst.

**Conclusion:**

SpeakToScrape transformed MarketLeap's lead generation process from a manual, time-consuming task into an automated, efficient engine for growth. By empowering a non-technical user to build a sophisticated data extraction pipeline, SpeakToScrape provided a significant return on investment and a competitive advantage.
